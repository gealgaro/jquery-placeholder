# jQuery Placeholder

This library was created to provide a simple yet useful tool to implement simple placeholders in web pages/forms etc, specially when using Password type fields.

### Simple and straightforward steps to use this plugin:

1. Include the script file (along with jQuery 1.7.x). => <script src="jquery.placeholder.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
2. Add the attribute 'data-placeholder' to input elements that you want to use on. => <input type="text" data-placeholder="Placeholder..." />
3. Call the placeholder function within the container of the input elements. => $('css rule container').placeholder();

## Please refer to examples for and example use.
